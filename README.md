MSc project adding 4D visualisation to open source graph layout software - www.biolayout.org

BioLayout Express 3D is a Java implementation of the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for graph layout. Nodes in a graph are placed according to similarity.

This project aims to add four dimensional geometry and a user interface allowing rotations in this space.
